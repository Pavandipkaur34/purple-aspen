**Strategies to Secure**- to secure a venture, we will keep our ideas secret so that no one can copy them.

we will use right ingredients and sell legal products in terms of safety and security of company.

**Strategies to Serve**- The most important strategy to serve the best in a business is that our employees who

represents the products first apply those products on them to show the application and the results. It

will show and give added perspective to share with our customers. Further more, we will serve products

to customers according to their needs as well as their budgets. We will use right ingredients and sell

legal products in terms of safety as well as security of company.

**Strategies to Retain**- To retain the customers, we will provide great services to our customers. There is lack of

consumers when they do not get effective service. Another thing we will do to retain our consumers

that we will keep in touch with our customer through some ways such as emails, telephone calls and

special events, follow-ups cards and many more. The most important is that if there will be any problem

to our customers then, we will be quick to resolve them and try to never let them face those problems.
