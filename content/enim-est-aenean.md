The major risks are- 

1. Product risk- As we all know that customer’s trust is very difficult to get but losing it can be very easy when the product is not safe. Sometimes a product does not suit on consumer’s skin, some people have allergies from raw materials, then it creates a very big risk on business. 
2. Market risk- New market trends posses a risk to a new business. My venture can get effected due to much competition in cosmetic industry and the pricing of products. As a new cosmetic brand that is saturated with same products and services can be detrimental to my venture to get significant market share. 
3. Financial risk- financial risk is another the major risk of my venture. It is very imperative for my venture to determine if my products and also services provided to customers are strong enough to support financial obligation of the business. A huge amount of money spends on manufacturing a product but it creates a big risk when consumers do not purchase them due to cost or ingredients. Increase in tax rate can also create financial risk. 
4. Reputation risk- It is one of the another main risk to my venture. No matter what kind of business or industry you are in, reputation is everything in a venture. One bad service and negative publicity can damage the reputation which affects the overall revenue of business. if one of our product will not suitable to any of our customers then it can be ruin our reputation. 
5. Government risk-  To start a new business, we have to follow some rules and regulations of government such as taxation, importing or exporting, product safety and so on. If the government change these rules and apply new one, then we will have face risk in our business. 
6. Team risk- Team plays an important role in a business to succeed. Team risk occurs when all members of a team do not work with co-operation and do not give their 100% in tasks and also if there will be interpersonal problems among team members. By this, productivity in the business could be effected.
